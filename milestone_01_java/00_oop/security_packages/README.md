## Security And Packages

Open your command prompt and `cd` into this README's directory (security_packages). The sample code **DOES NOT COMPILE**. Fix the security and package organization of this project. You will need to move or modify all files, including `Main.java`.

After you've finished, compile your code by running the following command:

``` bash
$ javac -d bin -classpath src/com/bloc/securitypackages/*/*.java src/com/bloc/securitypackages/*.java

After it compiles successfully, `cd` into the bin directory:

``` bash
$ cd bin/
```

From within bin, execute your code by running the following command:

``` bash
$ java com.bloc.securitypackages.Main
```

If you see a nice congrats message, everything's been properly organized!

Commit and push your changes often.
